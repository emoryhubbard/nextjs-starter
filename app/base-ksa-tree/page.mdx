### Activities

- Lessons

- Problems

- Projects

- All activities done and skills built in a TypeScript, Tailwind, and Next.js stack

- All activities use patterns or skills very helpful in industry except for ML activities which are specific to ML engineer roles or building AI products

### Most common software engineering skills

- Tracing

- Stepwise refinement

- DSA

- React FCs skill + FP skill + Interactive UI skill + Static typing skill (more efficient to train together)

- UI design

- Figma to code

- OOP

- SQL

### Lessons

- Activities without the word "problems" or "project" are lessons

- Certain lessons are required for other lessons, problems, and projects

- Lessons build understanding of patterns which can easily be reviewed later if weakened from disuse

### Problems

- Problems build skills and are done on the student's own time

- Certain skills are required for lessons, problems, and projects

- Problems can be repeated to restore skills weakened from disuse

- Skills implicitly use and build their prerequisite skills

- All skills are based on understanding patterns + pattern matching with those patterns--not pattern matching with specific problems

### Projects

- Projects are also done on the student's own time but are brief, optional, and not required for any activity

- Students choose to do projects if they want more confidence in skills or intrinsic motivation for building skills

- Projects build confidence in the skill by proving to the student that they can easily apply the skill to create a small app

- Equally important, the student chooses the exact project based on interest to build intrinsic motivation to learn the required skill

### Completed activities

- Tailwind

- Diagnostic exercises

### Lower-level activities

- All lower-level activities skipped due to excellent performance in diagnostic exercises
